# BrandonHenry-Projects
Hello my name is Brandon Henry,
firstly sorry this isn't polished as I do not have a lot of experience with GitHub.
I am a student at Washington State University going for my BA in Computer Science.
This Repository is meant to show case the work I've done at WSU and some tests 
files for them that were provided to me.
